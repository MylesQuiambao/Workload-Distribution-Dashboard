# Workload Distribution Dashboard

## Project Background

The purpose for the development of this dashboard is to support the business owner and head of operations in overseeing the day-to-day operations by providing minimal but effective visuals that give insight to the workload allocation for each staff member. This also also serves as a reporting format to share with staff to provide background and transparency with the company's business decisions. 

The data was housed through a third-party software and was imported, cleaned, and anonymized in Excel then visualized in Power BI.
